> [!TIP]
> **[Towards the Cloud](https://towardsthecloud.com/about) eliminates AWS complexity so you ship faster with confidence, cut costs by 30%, and become compliant.**
>
> Sounds too good to be true? We'll assess your AWS account for free and report exactly where you stand. You'll receive a report with security findings and cost optimization opportunities. After that you can decide whether to fix these findings yourself or let us handle it. No strings attached.

> ### AWS complexity builds faster than you realize
>
> What starts as a simple deployment quickly spirals into inefficient architectures that cost 40-60% more than needed, security blind spots that risk customer data, and teams that burnout from managing operations on AWS instead of building product.
>
> **Traditional consultancies prioritize billable hours over outcomes, then disappear after setup. We do the opposite...**

> ### We provide a complete package, so you deploy faster with confidence on AWS Cloud
>
> - ‚úÖ **[Compliant multi-account Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)**:
>   - Provisions AWS accounts with security guardrails out of the box - 100% [CIS benchmark compliant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)
>   - Secure Single Sign-On (SSO) for clean user access management
>   - Everything is built using AWS CDK ensuring consistency, version control, and repeatable deployments
>   - See what features are already included in our landing zone on our [public roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#features)
> - ‚úÖ **Off-the-shelf compliant CDK components**: Develop secure infra quicker without reinventing the wheel
> - ‚úÖ **Complete CI/CD with easy rollbacks**: Deploy more frequently because of IaC safety
> - ‚úÖ **Quarterly checks**: Proactively receive [Cost Optimization assessments](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) + [Security Reviews](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review)
> - ‚úÖ **Fractional Cloud Engineer**: On-demand access to a decade of AWS Cloud experience to help you use best practices
>
> ---
>
> ### What results can you expect when you partner with us:
>
> - **30% Lower AWS Bill**: Proactive quarterly reviews catch overspending before it happens [(30-60% documented savings)](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study)
> - **Accelerate SOC 2/HIPAA compliance**: Our Landing Zone automatically sets up security guardrails on your AWS accounts with 100% CIS compliance from day one
> - **Easily stay compliant**: Our automated monitoring and proactive quarterly security reviews give you control so yearly audits are smooth, not stressful
> - **Your Team Ships Faster**: Our Pre-built secure infrastructure components let your team focus on product, not AWS
> - **Save on hiring costs**: Access expert Cloud knowledge through our [flexible retainer](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) instead of committing to a full-time Cloud Engineer
>
> **Proof:** Y Combinator startup Accolade's founder on how our Landing Zone [accelerated their SOC 2 certification](https://towardsthecloud.com/blog/aws-landing-zone-case-study-accolade):
